Personal Agenda for Indico
==========================

This plugin adds the possibility for conference participants to star their favorite sessions and
build an agenda for their conference. It also gives event managers the opportunity to see which
contributions have received the most stars.

It works best in combination with the
[NGTimetable](https://github.com/canonical/canonical-indico-ngtimetable) plugin.
